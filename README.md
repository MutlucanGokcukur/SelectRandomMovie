# SelectRandomMovie
Want to watch a movie but don't know exactly what to watch?
Don't want to spend time researching movies and are looking for a good movie?

Then this project is for you
This application randomly selects a movie for you from among the 250 movies with the highest IMDb(Internet Movie Database) score.
You can get information about the movie selected by the application on 'Wikipedia' or you can watch the trailer on 'Youtube'.

Did you come across a movie you watched before on the list? No problem
You can add the selected series to a database by pressing the 'I've Watched Before' button. In this way, you will not see this movie on the lists again and you will have a database of movies you have watched before.

This application is a simple project that I developed alone to improve myself. You can help me develop my project by contacting me.
